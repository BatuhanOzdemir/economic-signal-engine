# Economic Signal Engine (ESE)

Economic Signal Engine is a configuration-driven CLI tool that ingests macroeconomic time series (starting with TCMB EVDS),
stores them locally, computes reusable metrics, and generates rule-based signals (info/warn/risk) as reproducible reports.

## Why this exists
Raw macro data may be available, but turning it into consistent, automated decision signals requires:
- normalized storage
- reproducible metrics
- configurable rules
- audit-friendly outputs (JSON/Markdown)

## Features
- Config-driven ingestion (EVDS first; extensible providers)
- Local storage (SQLite/DuckDB)
- Metrics: YoY, MoM, rolling stats (z-score, volatility, etc.)
- Rule-based signals with severities
- Reports in JSON and Markdown
- End-to-end `run` command for daily/weekly profiles

## Quickstart
1) Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set EVDS key
2) Validate config
3) Ingest series
4) Compute metrics
5) Generate signals
6) Export report

## Example commands
- `ese validate --config configs/sources.yaml`
- `ese ingest --source evds --series CPI,USDTRY --start 2010-01-01`
- `ese compute --metrics yoy,mom,rolling_z --series CPI`
- `ese signal --rules configs/rules.yaml`
- `ese report --format md --out reports/latest.md`

## Output
Signals are emitted with timestamps and severity levels and can be exported as:
- JSON (machine-readable)
- Markdown (shareable report)

## Roadmap
- More providers (FRED/ECB)
- Revision/vintage support
- Scheduling integrations (cron/systemd)
- Basic dashboard exporter
